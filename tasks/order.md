# Task Execution Order

This document outlines the recommended order for working on the project tasks, ensuring dependencies are respected and the workflow is efficient.

1. **01-project-setup.md**
   - Rationale: Establishes the foundational project structure, tools, and environment required for all subsequent work.
2. **07-database-backend.md**
   - Rationale: Sets up the database schema and backend, which are prerequisites for most features.
3. **02-authentication.md**
   - Rationale: User management and authentication are core to access control and must be in place before building user-facing features.
4. **06-subscription-billing.md**
   - Rationale: Billing logic often ties into user and domain management, and should be ready before exposing premium features.
5. **03-campaign-management.md**
   - Rationale: Core business logic for campaign creation and management, dependent on users and backend.
6. **04-url-management.md**
   - Rationale: UTM and link management depend on campaigns and user data.
7. **05-reporting-analytics.md**
   - Rationale: Analytics and reporting require campaign and link data to be meaningful.
8. **08-frontend-development.md**
   - Rationale: UI development can proceed in parallel but benefits from having backend and API contracts defined.
9. **09-testing-qa.md**
   - Rationale: Testing infrastructure should be established early, but comprehensive tests are best written as features stabilize.
10. **10-devops-deployment.md**
    - Rationale: Deployment and DevOps tasks can be refined as the application matures and more features are integrated.
11. **11-documentation.md**
    - Rationale: Documentation is an ongoing process but should be finalized after features and infrastructure are complete.
